# BC-Tool

Please NOTE: It requires JAVA INSTALLED! If you don't have it, you can find it on 
https://www.java.com/it/

#How to use it?
Be sure to move it into a dedicated folder or in your desktop.
When you run it for the first time I highly suggest you to go into settings panel and change DEFAULT into your username, then hit save. (this will create a .propeties file that you can't delete)

Then do whatever you want. Wanna calculate a window? Go to the window tab.
Are you running a sector? Go into the book checking tab and use the buttons to automatically write the text on your screen.
It will simulate your keyboard inputs, so if you have some binded macro it will start them too! Be sure to have a disable macro hotkey.
